# Basics Of Programming Languages

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions which tells a 
computer how to perform a task.

## Types Of Languages

- Low Level Languages.
- High Level Languages.

### Low Level Languages

#### Assembly Level Language

Low-level programming that is intended to communicate directly with hardware.

### High Level Languages

Easy to understand and less complex than assembly level language/machine code.

#### Types Of High Level Languages.

- Procedural
- Functional
- Object-Oriented

##### Procedural:
- It is written in set of procedures which executes in a structure/serial order.\
- Procedures are also known as subroutine/function.\
- e.g. C, Basic, Pascal etc. 

##### Functional:
- We functions to write the code.\
- Functions are chunks/block of code which can use over and over again.\
- They can also take parameters.\
- e.g. Python, JavaScript etc.\

##### Object-Oriented:
- We use object and classes.\
- Classed are user defined prototype/blueprints which can be used to create
objects.\
- Object are real life entity.\
- e.g. C++, Java, C# etc.\

##### Class:
We can define some properties, attributes, methods etc.

##### Object:
Instance of a class which allows to use variables and methods from class.

# CPP Programming Language.
- It is Object-Oriented Programming Language.
- But it also has support for procedural programming.
- Initially it was intended to developed as a superset of C but later on it 
became a new programming language.
- Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in **1979**.



## Data Structure And Algorithm

It is foundational blocks of a big building named as program.

### Data Structure

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize 
data.

### Algorithm
An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
